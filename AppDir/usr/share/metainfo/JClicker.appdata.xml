        <p>
            Linux native autoclicker that was written because I wanted to play cookie clicker but the only other autoclicker I found did not have global shortcuts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Features: Global shotrcuts. Configurable delay (Hours, Minutes, Seconds, Milliseconds, Nanoseconds). Can click every button on the mouse including back and forwards.
        </p>
        <p>
            Missing features Clicking keyboard keys. Theming only dark theme so far because swing is going to give me an aneurysm.
